# POST /albums Route Design Recipe

_Copy this design recipe template to test-drive a Sinatra route._

## 1. Design the Route Signature

You'll need to include:
  * the HTTP method
  * the path
  * any query parameters (passed in the URL)
  * or body parameters (passed in the request body)

Request:
POST /artists

With body parameters:
name=Wild nothing
genre=Indie

Expected response (200 OK)
(No content)

Then subsequent request:
GET /artists

Expected response (200 OK)
Pixies, ABBA, Taylor Swift, Nina Simone, Wild nothing

## 2. Design the Response

The route might return different responses, depending on the result.

For example, a route for a specific blog post (by its ID) might return `200 OK` if the post exists, but `404 Not Found` if the post is not found in the database.

Your response might return plain text, JSON, or HTML code. 

_Replace the below with your own design. Think of all the different possible responses your route will return._

```html
<!-- EXAMPLE -->
<!-- Response when the post is found: 200 OK -->
Response: None (just creates the resource on the server)
```

## 3. Write Examples

_Replace these with your own design._

```
# Request:

POST /artists?name=Wild nothing&genre=Indie

# Expected response:

Response for 200 OK
(No content)
```

## 4. Encode as Tests Examples

```ruby
# EXAMPLE
# file: spec/integration/application_spec.rb

require "spec_helper"

describe Application do
  include Rack::Test::Methods

  let(:app) { Application.new }

  context "POST /artists" do
    it 'returns 200 OK' do
      post('/artists?name=Wild nothing&genre=Indie')
      response = get('/artists')
      expected_response = 'Pixies, ABBA, Wild nothing'
      expect(response.status).to eq(200)
      expect(response.body).to eq(expected_response)
    end
  end
end
```

## 5. Implement the Route

Write the route and web server code to implement the route behaviour.
