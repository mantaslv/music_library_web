# GET /albums Route Design Recipe

_Copy this design recipe template to test-drive a Sinatra route._

## 1. Design the Route Signature

You'll need to include:
  * the HTTP method
  * the path
  * any query parameters (passed in the URL)
  * or body parameters (passed in the request body)

Request: 
GET /albums

Expected response: 
list of albums

## 2. Design the Response

The route might return different responses, depending on the result.

For example, a route for a specific blog post (by its ID) might return `200 OK` if the post exists, but `404 Not Found` if the post is not found in the database.

Your response might return plain text, JSON, or HTML code. 

_Replace the below with your own design. Think of all the different possible responses your route will return._

```html
<!-- EXAMPLE -->
<!-- Response when the post is found: 200 OK -->

#1 Doolittle - Release year: 1989 - Artist ID: 1
#2 Surfer Rosa - Release year: 1988 - Artist ID: 2

```

## 3. Write Examples

_Replace these with your own design._

```
# Request:

GET /albums

# Expected response:

Response for 200 OK:
#1 Doolittle - Release year: 1989 - Artist ID: 1
#2 Surfer Rosa - Release year: 1988 - Artist ID: 2

```



## 4. Encode as Tests Examples

```ruby
# EXAMPLE
# file: spec/integration/application_spec.rb

require "spec_helper"

describe Application do
  include Rack::Test::Methods

  let(:app) { Application.new }

  context "GET /albums" do
    it 'returns 200 OK' do
      response = get('/albums')

      expect(response.status).to eq(200)
      expect(response.body).to eq('Doolittle, Surfer Rosa')
    end
  end
end
```

## 5. Implement the Route

Write the route and web server code to implement the route behaviour.
